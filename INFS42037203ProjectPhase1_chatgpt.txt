Project INFS4203/7203 - Semester 2, 2023

**Important Assignment Submission Guidelines:**
1. All assignments must be submitted through UQ Blackboard; no other forms of submission are accepted.
2. Failure to submit an assignment appropriately before the due date will result in a penalty, as outlined in the ECP.
3. Ensure your assignment is successfully submitted before the designated deadline.
4. Email submissions will not be accepted under any circumstances.

**Overview:**
The objective of this assignment is to assess your ability to apply data mining techniques to solve real-world problems. It is an individual task, and your completion should be based on your own design.

**Project Phases and Submission Deadlines:**
- Phase 1 (Project Proposal): Due by 16:00 on 15th September 2023 (15% of the total project grade).
- Phase 2 (Project Report): Due by 16:00 on 27th October 2023 (20% of the total project grade).

**Project Tracks:**
You can choose between two project tracks:
1. Data-oriented project
2. Competition-oriented project

**Data-oriented Project:**
- Utilizes the "train.csv" dataset, which simulates real-world scenarios with various complexities.
- Objective: Develop a classifier capable of accurately classifying data points into ten classes.
- Performance evaluated using test data released in Week 9.

**Phase 1 - Project Proposal (15 Marks):**
The proposal should cover these aspects:
1. Discuss the need for pre-processing techniques (outlier detection, normalization, imputation) based on dataset analysis.
2. Describe the process of applying classification techniques (decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, naive bayes) and hyperparameter tuning by cross-validation.
3. Explain how to evaluate the model and select the appropriate performance metric.
4. Provide a timeline for Phase 2.

**Using Generative AI:**
Students can use AI tools, like ChatGPT, for revising their proposal. Proper acknowledgment and documentation are essential, and in-person interviews may be required.

**Format:**
Follow the Proposal_Template.doc style, and the submission should be within four pages, including all references and illustrations.

**Submission:**
Submit the proposal in PDF or Doc (Docx) format through the "Proposal submission" Turnitin link on Blackboard before the deadline.

**Phase 2 - Project Report (20 Marks):**
In this phase, you implement the ideas from your proposal and classify test data. Only techniques covered in lectures are allowed. Specific details will be provided in Week 9.

**Competition-oriented Project:**
Engage in a data mining-related online competition with satisfactory test performance. Detailed information is provided about the competition's eligibility and guidelines.

**Phase 1 - Project Proposal (15 Marks):**
Proposal requirements:
1. Describe the competition task and basic dataset statistics.
2. Discuss pre-processing techniques and their relevance based on dataset analysis.
3. Describe the procedure for applying classification techniques and hyperparameter tuning, including an ensemble approach.
4. Explain the model evaluation process.
5. Provide a timeline for Phase 2.

**Using Generative AI:**
Usage of generative AI tools for proposal revision is allowed with proper acknowledgment and documentation.

**Format:**
Follow the Proposal_Template.doc style, and the submission should be within six pages, including all references and illustrations.

**Submission:**
Submit the proposal in PDF or Doc (Docx) format through the "Proposal submission" Turnitin link on Blackboard before the deadline. Multiple submissions are allowed, with the last version being marked.

**Phase 2 - Project Report (20 Marks):**
Implement your proposal ideas and achieve a good position in the competition's public leaderboard. You can choose any programming language.

**Marking Standard:**
Evidence of your achievements in the public leaderboard is required by the project deadline. Earned marks depend on your ranking compared to other competitors.
